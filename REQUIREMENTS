GStreamer uses a *large* array of tools and libraries, most of which are
optional. We have attempted to make sure that any code that depends on
optional libraries doesn't get built unless you have those libraries. If
you find this not to be the case, please, let us know by filing a bug
report at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.

Required tools:
===============

An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer
from git (using autogen.sh):

autoconf  >= 2.68   https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
automake  >= 1.11   https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
libtool   >= 2.2.6  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
pkgconfig >= 0.9.0  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

Required libraries:
===================

Package:        GStreamer
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.

Package:        GStreamer Base Plugins
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.


Optional libraries:
===================

This file lists supporting libraries for which gst-plugins-good contains
plugins, as well as their minimum required version. You can find the
corresponding plugins in ext/(library)


Optional (debian) packages:
===========================

gtk-doc-tools >= 1.12  -- needed to build documentation
python-xml  -- needed to build plugin documentation
